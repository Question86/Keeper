## FINAL
Loop 7 completed.

Key outcomes:
- Added Reply Re-Shaper feature (3-panel: Context / Draft / Output) using local LLM.
- Integrated Re-Shaper as a dedicated view with keyboard shortcut and fast handoff from Chat.
- Fixed Chat message thread rendering issues and improved overall UI/UX polish.
- Adjusted layout so Compose-only controls no longer squash Chat/Re-Shaper views.

Task disposition:
- TASK_0007 closed with scope amendment deferring security/testing work.
