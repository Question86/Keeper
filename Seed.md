# PROJECT_DESCRIPTION

The project description - a chat window (lokal input box) the sends a text plus an additional instruction snippet of choice to my local mistral LLM, allows a remodulation of the text by me or my llm and THEN allows the finalized version to be forwarded in any other chat (like discord, battlenetchat, telegram.. should be agnostic)
