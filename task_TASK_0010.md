# TASK_0010

MODE: APPEND-ONLY

---

## SPEC

**Goal:**
Fix app readability by moving the UI to a dark-mode-friendly background and ensuring there is no “white on white” text.

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Update global/background styling so the app background is dark and text remains readable.
- Ensure all primary surfaces (header, panels, text areas, lists, message bubbles) have sufficient contrast.
- Do not add new features; this is strictly a UI styling/readability task.

**Success Criteria:**
- No primary screen area renders white text on a white (or near-white) background.
- App is readable without manual CSS overrides.

**Priority:**
10 (HIGH)
