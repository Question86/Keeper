MODE: APPEND-ONLY

## SPEC

**Goal:**
Write and save a complete final project report for Keeper, using time-linear context gathered from archives, tasks, and reports.

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Reconstruct a time-linear narrative of the project from Loop 1 through Loop 10 using:
  - archive/ARCHIV_0001.md … archive/ARCHIV_0010.md
  - task_TASK_0001.md … task_TASK_0010.md
  - report_TASK_0001_L01_v01.md … report_TASK_0010_L10_v01.md
- Capture:
  - Scope evolution (what changed and why)
  - Major technical decisions and reversals
  - Key fixes and features shipped
  - Current system architecture (Electron/React/Vite, IPC, Discord, Ollama, SQLite)
  - Current status and remaining known gaps/risks
- Save the report as the Loop 11 report file.

**Success Criteria:**
- Final report exists, is internally consistent, and is based on the archived evidence chain.
- No invented claims that contradict tasks/reports/archives.

**Priority:**
11 (HIGH)
