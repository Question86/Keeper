SYSTEM LAWS OVERRIDE ALL OTHER SECTIONS IN THIS DOCUMENT.

---

## UNIVERSAL LAWS (GLOBAL / NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. REPORT-FIRST LAW  
   Any non-trivial work requires a dedicated report file.  
   No report → work is invalid.

2. NO INLINE CONTEXT  
   Core documents may contain references only, never content.

3. REFERENCE FORMAT LAW  
   All references MUST follow:  
   [ref:DOC#SECTION|v:ID|tags:...|src:...]

4. LOOP FINALITY  
   One loop produces exactly one archive file.

5. ARCHIVE IMMUTABILITY  
   Archive files are final and never edited or reopened.

6. AMNESIA IS A FEATURE  
   After loop finalization, all working context is discarded.  
   Only this file and NEURAL_CORTEX.md may be retained.

7. LOCATION LAW  
   Each document is a location with allowed actions.  
   Wrong location → STOP.

8. POINTER-ONLY CORE  
   NEURAL_CORTEX.md, NEU.md, ALT.md contain pointers only.

9. DETERMINISTIC NAMING  
   All files use canonical, zero-padded names.

10. VIOLATION = INVALID OUTPUT
